# Landing Page Project
This is Landing Page Project for [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), my current online learning center. In this project, i was to show a Navigation bar built dynamically as an unordered list, be clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page, and when clicking a link from the navigation bar the link should scroll to the appropriate section.

# What page should show
* When clicking on Link on the nav bar should have smooth scrool to the correct section
* When scrolling thru sections should see background circles should change to while scrolling thru section to show which section you are on.
